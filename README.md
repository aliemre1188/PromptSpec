# PromptSpec

PromptSpec is a deterministic, client-side prompt compiler that turns vague ideas into production-grade prompts before any AI model is involved. Instead of chatting with an LLM and iterating blindly, users specify intent, constraints, environment, and risk tolerance once, and PromptSpec compiles this into a meta-prompt that instructs any LLM to generate a precise, reusable master prompt.

The system runs entirely in the browser—no accounts, no APIs, no data storage—making it GDPR-safe by design. It’s model-agnostic and works equally well for ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, no-code builders, or automation tools. PromptSpec solves the real bottleneck in AI work: not model quality, but poor problem specification.

In short: PromptSpec standardizes problem formulation so AI outputs become predictable, auditable, and reusable instead of fragile and ad-hoc.
